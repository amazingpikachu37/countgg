        About counting.gg
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }}>
        counting.gg is a free community-driven counting website. The community is centered around our Discord server, and a Discord
        account is required to join.
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }}>
        After signing up, you'll need to create your profile. To avoid abuse, profiles are manually approved at the moment. If your
        account is not approved in a reasonable amount of time, please message the moderators.
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }}>Once your profile is approved, you'll be ready to count!</Typography>

        Why? Why would people waste their time on this?

        Can I use bots to count?

        How does the site work?
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }}>
        The site is divided into several "threads," each having their own unique rules. The main thread is the simplest—count up 1 at a
        time. No double counting, and mistakes are allowed.
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }}>
        Other threads have different rules. Some threads may reset on a mistake. Other threads may not count by numbers—the "letters"
        thread counts from A to Z, then AA, AB, and so on...
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }}>
        You can access a list of threads from the left-hand sidebar, under "Threads." Once you open a thread, there is an about page
        with more information.
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }} variant="h4">
        Is counting.gg free?

        How can I contact you?

        I have more questions!

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }}>
        Feel free to sign up to join the discord. There's zero commitment in joining and you can quit whenever you need to. Ask others
        and feel free to send a direct message to the discord admins if needed.
